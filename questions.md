# Meeting Questions — Friends of the Hearing Center

# Context

They're both in shock that they found someone to do it. 

Currently all in a giant sheet.
- 827, grows constantly 
- Currently have them shared in a PDF document

Goal is to support kids being treated at Hearing Center, regardless of hearing loss, communication choices, and to make them as successful and independent as possible, to provide thme resources



Sarah Grimm: Teacher
Jessica Lampert: Liasion

This book list and the literacy initiative in general was Sarah's baby. It's one of those things they started and then it grew quite popular and quite an undertaking. 
SG: Rarely do kids see other kids with hearing aids or cochlears in media.
- Tried to find what books are out there.
- Blossomed into a free book fair and tried to partner with publishers, authors, sponsors, to buy these books that kids don't have access to, and get it to them

Would like to share outside of this little bubble. 
But currently it's just in list form. There's a list of titles, with no ways of sorting through, unless they go and research them all. 

Hope is to have a website version where they can see the cover and provide information
- Is it a deaf/hoh author?

We'd love to hear from kids themselves what they think of this book, and collect some reviews that way
- Not planning to have it be open source where everyone can post a review
- But teachers, speech therapists, parents, will help childs put in a review. 
- So less "100 people rate 5 stars" as "here's what one of our friends says about it"



User interaction 
- Want to potentially link to titles, because they're not always findable on Amazon
Maybe down the line, affiliated links would be nice. 
A way they can filter and see all the kids with hearing aids, all the picture books. 


JL: I'm really bad with technology
- Is there a way people could leave reviews, but it would have to be approved first? (I told them this would make it a dynamic website, which would be a phase 2 project)
- Allow kids across the country to access. 
- Want site to be available nationwide when we go places, because this would be something for a donor or a sponsor. 


SG: Static preferred is a great place to start for us. 
- How easy would it be for us to add new books or things like that? 




## Data & Content
- Can we see the Google Sheet? (The column structure tells us exactly what fields to support, and we can potentially import it directly rather than re-entering data)
    -  Just Master List. Other tabs are info. 
    -  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kcqTRybN6kjPy45mhwmQLRz9g5kiXJMmPbpV8kKmcmQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0
- Are there fields they track that they *wouldn't* want public? (e.g., internal notes)
    - Will need cleaned up some, because all the highlights are information we're still searching for. It will need cleaned up in terms of age ranges (which vary). 
- How many books are on the list currently? (10? 100? 500? Affects UI decisions)
    - 800
    - Some missing additional information 

## Reviews
- Who will be writing reviews — patients, families, staff, general public?
    - Children, facilitated by 
    - Some high school patients?
- Do reviews need moderation/approval before going live, or are they trusted?
    - You're handling that.
- Is a star rating important, or more qualitative?
    - Can use a star rating, but would like to copy their text view in.
    - Potentially a picture of the reviewer  
- Big design decision: a moderated review system needs a backend, while a simpler approach (collect reviews via Google Form, someone adds them periodically) keeps the site fully static and free
    - Simpler approach for now. 

## Branding & Identity
- Do they have a logo, brand colors, or existing visual identity?
    - Have Facebook, Insta, Google Site, and hard materials like binders and folders 
    - Jess has all the color codes in canva, can get them to you.
        - Jess: I need to think about the logo before being given to you. Got permission from supervisor to start project, unsure how to do logo, need to finalize. 
- Is "Friends of the Hearing Center" the public-facing name for this initiative, or does the book list have its own name?
    - Jessica: "Friends of the Hearing Center ". 
    - Need time to think about it. For now, can use a placeholder.
    - Current google site is off brand, never approved or denied. 
- Are they affiliated with a specific hearing center they'd want linked/referenced?
    - UPMC Children's Hospital Hearing Center

## Audience & Discovery
- How do people currently find the PDF? (Shared by staff? Social media? Website?)
    - Yes to all of the above. 
- Who's the primary audience — parents looking for books for their kids, adults looking for representation, educators/librarians?
    - Parents, teachers, therapists, maybe teen-age patients, but probably majority are parents, teachers, therapists
    - SLPs (Speech Language Pathologist), Audiologists, Behavior Health Psychologist on Cochlear Implant Teams. 
- Would they want the URL to be shareable with specific filters (e.g., "here are all the picture books with hearing aids") — useful for staff making recommendations
    - That would be great. 

## Maintenance & Workflow
- Who would be responsible for updating the site? How technical are they?
    - Sarah Grimm 
- How often do they add new books? (Weekly? A few times a year?)
    - Add new books to master list pretty regularly, but update PDF twice a year. 
    - Adding new books monthly, mostly Sarah and one other person. 
- Ideal workflow: keep editing the Google Sheet and have the site pull from it? Or would they switch to editing a different way?
    - That'd be great. 

## Hosting & Logistics
- Do they have a domain name, or would something like `friendsofthehearingcenter.github.io` work?
- Does anyone on their team have a GitHub account? (If not, you could own it and give them access later)

Would prefer to link to Libra or Amazon. 

Links are currently pretty much all Amazon. 
- We can hold off on the links for now. 

## Images
- Sarah: I can get a cover photo of the books or an Image URL.  
- We don't want to link to Amazon. 

Two weeks?
- That'd be great. 

# Timeline and Publishing Procedure
Would like to get it done this year. (I told them it would be done quite a bit earlier than that)
JL: We may love it and be ready to do it, but need permission from the grownups (i.e., UPMC) to promote it and share it. 

JL heard from one of her superiors "Do what you need to do and we'll figure out the rest." It'll be easier to sell a product versus an idea. If we have a thing that's already done, it's harder for them to say no. 
- Basically, will UPMC put logo on it, or are we going rogue
- More inclined to not put UPMC on it. 

At some point, we'll need your logo and information, because when we do launch, we'll give you credit. "Created by Lemali Consulting."
